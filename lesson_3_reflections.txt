When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd use a remote when you're switching between working at work and at home and/or when you're collaborating with other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   Fork: A clone of another person's repo on GitHub to your GitHub account that you can set up as a remote to your local machine.
   Clone: A copy of your own repo on your local machine. A copy of your repo from your local machine to your GitHub account. 
   Branch: A new parent for commits within an existing repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  The benefit is that you can go offline and continue to make commits on your local machine and then have a common ancestor be able to compare your local commits and any new commits on the remote.
