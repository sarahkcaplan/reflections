How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could zero-in on the changes that were made and see the mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So that I can go directly to the place (in the document and in time) when I made a change

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that you can decide that something is a major enough change and it's a good point to save.
    Cons are that you might forget to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is for software and those pages may refer to eachother to run.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows log of all commits and git diff shows changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back! You have each step/change along the way saved. You can go back many small steps, not just one big step.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
